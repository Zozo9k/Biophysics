# Chemical reaction networks - quantum simulations

This project was part of my master thesis to simulate the dynamics of chemical reaction networks, in particular the one of the cAMP, using inferred properties from quantum many-body simulations. Quantum Monte Carlo methods could not be used due to the non-Hermitian properties of the system, but the conservation of a quantity (the AC enzyme) allowed to reduce the Hilbert space drastically, which allowed to perform the computations in an exact form.
